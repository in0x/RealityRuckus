# Reality Rucks
RR is a 2D semi turn-based Roguelike called, being developed in cooperation with 2 of my fellow students as part of our MMP2a (MultiMediaProject).

In Reality Ruckus, you are a hero who has been chosen to restore order to time and space following a catastrophic event which collapsed multiple realites into each other. Along the way you will meet fellow heroes who have been forced to leave their dimension.

You will have to explore randomly generated areas and face a multitude of foes in order to collect fragments of an artifact, which is the only hope to restore order back to space and time.

Upon finding all artifact fragments in an area, your hero will have to travel to the next dimension, where he will have to face new challenges.

Reality Ruckus is built using SFML in combination with TGUI

### Contributions
Most of the code in this project has been touched by all of us at one point or another. There are however a few modules that I wrote on my own, which I'm proud of. These would be a good place to get a feel for my code:

   [Pathfinding (aStar and Graph stuff)](https://github.com/in0x/RealityRuckus/blob/master/src/aStarSearch.cpp)
   [AI](https://github.com/in0x/RealityRuckus/blob/master/src/AIComponent.cpp)
